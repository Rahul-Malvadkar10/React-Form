This is a simple React application for data passing between parent and child components using React hooks. The app allows data to be passed from the parent component to the child component, and the child component sends data back to the parent.


## Files

1. **App.js**: This is the main file for the parent component where state is managed, and data is passed to the child component and received back from the child.
2. **Child.js**: This is the child component where it receives data from the parent, and allows the user to input data which is sent back to the parent.
3. **style.css**: External stylesheet to style the parent and child components.
   
## Features

1 Parent to Child Data Passing**: The parent component sends data to the child.

2 Child to Parent Data Passing**: The child component sends data back to the parent using a function passed as a prop.

3 Simple React Styling**: The components are styled using external CSS for a clean and responsive UI.
